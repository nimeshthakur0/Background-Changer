# Background Changer

This project is a simple React application that allows users to change the background color of the page. It's built with React and Vite, showcasing the use of state management in React and providing a minimal setup for rapid development with hot module replacement (HMR).

## Features

- Change the background color of the page by clicking buttons.
- Demonstrates the use of React state and event handling.
- Utilizes Vite for a fast development experience.
